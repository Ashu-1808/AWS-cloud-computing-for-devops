# Placement Groups (AWS)

##  What is a Placement Group?
---
A Placement Group is a logical grouping of EC2 instances that controls how instances are placed on the underlying hardware.

It helps optimize:
  1. Performance
  2. Availability
  3. Fault tolerance
Depending on the workload type.

---

## Types of Placement Groups

There are 3 types:
1. Cluster
2. Spread
3. Partition

#1. Cluster Placement Group
 Concept
  1. Instances are placed **close together**
  2. In the **same Availability Zone (AZ)**
  3. On the **same underlying network**
    
 Characteristics
  1. Very **low network latency**
  2. Very **high network throughput**
  3. Instances share close physical proximity
  4. Higher risk if hardware fails
    
 Risk
  1. If the hardware fails, multiple instances may be affected
    
 Use Cases
  1. High Performance Computing (HPC)
  2. Big Data analytics
  3. Real-time processing
  4. Applications requiring fast inter-node communication
    
 Key Point
  ✔ Very low latency
  ✔ Very high throughput
  ❌ If rack fails → multiple instances affected

#2. Spread Placement Group
 Concept
  1. Instances are placed on **separate hardware**
  2. Each instance is isolated

 Characteristics
  1. Maximum hardware isolation
  2. Reduced risk of simultaneous failure
  3. Limited number of instances per AZ (usually 7 per AZ)

 Use Cases
  1. Critical applications
  2. Small number of important instances
  3. Applications requiring high availability

 Key Point:
  ✔ High fault tolerance
  ✔ Safe for critical apps
 ❌ Limited instances per AZ

#3.Partition Placement Group
 Concept
  1. Instances are divided into **multiple partitions**
  2. Each partition is on separate hardware racks
  3. Failure in one partition does NOT affect others

 Characteristics
  1. Good balance of performance and fault tolerance
  2. Up to 7 partitions per AZ
  3. Each partition has isolated infrastructure

 Use Cases
  1. Large distributed systems
  2. Hadoop
  3. Cassandra
  4. Kafka

 Key Point:   
  ✔ Balance of performance + fault tolerance
  ✔ Best for distributed systems (Hadoop, Kafka)

# 🔥 Quick Comparison Table

| Type      | Performance | Fault Tolerance | Best For            |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Cluster   | 4/5       | 1/5               | HPC, Big Data       |
| Spread    | 1/5           | 5/5           | Critical small apps |
| Partition | 3/5         | 4/5            | Distributed systems |
