# AWS

## Cloud Computing :
Cloud computing is on demand delivery of compute power, database and other resources through a cloud provider via internet.

# Services in cloud:
1.IaaS → Infrastructure As A Service
2.PaaS → Platform As A Service
3.SaaS → Software As A Service

## Hypervisor :
It helps in virtualization in AWS
It is a software that create and runs virtual machine

## Virtualization :
It is a technique simply the use of software to build virtual layer over hardware allowing the hardware to be used more efficiently


## ABOUT AWS
- Nitro Hypervisor used by AWS before they used XEN

- Default region in AWS is North-Virginia (us-east-1)
North Virginia has 6 zones

- Region: A region is a different geographical area like apsouth, useast, uswest and all regions are isolated from each other

- Availability zone are physically separated data center within region and availability zone are also isolated from each other
